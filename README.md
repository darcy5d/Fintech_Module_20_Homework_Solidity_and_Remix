# Solidity Joint Savings Smart Contract

## Background Summary

In this project, we're developing a smart contract for a fintech startup leveraging an Ethereum-compatible blockchain to innovate in the finance sector. The main objective is to create a Solidity-based smart contract for automating joint savings accounts in financial institutions. This contract will allow two user addresses to manage a joint savings account, with capabilities to deposit and withdraw funds, fulfilling the unique requirements of financial institutions.

## Development and Deployment

The development involves creating the `JointSavings` contract in Solidity, including critical functionalities for managing joint accounts. Key steps include defining necessary variables, implementing functions for withdrawals and deposits, and ensuring security checks. Post-development, the contract is compiled and deployed using the JavaScript VM in Remix IDE, ensuring it operates as intended without errors.
